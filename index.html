      <h3>Why is encryption important?</h3>
      <p>
        Encryption protects data from theft, alteration, or compromise by
        converting it into a secret code accessible only with a unique digital
        key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data encryption is important because it helps protect people's privacy,
        and secures data from attackers and other cybersecurity threats.

        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Can encryption be misused?</h3>
      <p>
        Attackers can use encryption to hold a victim's data or device hostage,
        demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. This type of
        attack, known as ransomware, is becoming increasingly common and can
        cause significant financial or reputational damage to victims.
      </p>
      <p>
        Misuse of cryptography can include using encryption to hide the contents
        of illegal messages, using stolen or fake digital certificates to
        impersonate legitimate entities, or using weak or compromised encryption
        algorithms that can be easily broken.

      <h3>Encrypted ransomware: Holding digital assets hostage</h3>
      <p>
        In the world of cyber threats, ransomware has become increasingly
        infamous. These malicious software strains encrypt victims' files or
        entire systems, holding them ransom until a fee, often demanded in
        cryptocurrency, is paid. Due to the strong encryption algorithms
        employed, victims are typically unable to regain access to their files
        without the decryption key held by the attacker. This form of
        cyber-extortion has targeted not only individuals but major
        corporations, hospitals, and even city governments.

      <h3>Discussion on real-life ethical concerns about encryption</h3>
      <p>
        The ethical dilemma surrounding encryption revolves around the tension
        between privacy rights and national security imperatives. On one hand,
        advocating for strong encryption is paramount to safeguarding individual
        privacy, ensuring freedom of speech, and fostering trust in digital
        technologies.
